# shotclock

Hello fellow coffee enthusiasts or stray internet explorer. If you haven't already figured out, this little application is a stopwatch-esque tool for timing and tracking your coffee experiences. shotclock aims to be a fast and mobile friendly and is made using a suite of modern tools to get the job done.

The inspiration for this little project spawned from a recent binge of [James Hoffman](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMb0O2CdPBNi-QqPk5T3gsQ) videos, some of which regarding the sorry state of most “smart” scales. His complete and utter dismay, coupled with my realization of how much these smart features cost, led me to investigate if I could make something better.

Unfortunately, the one feature I am (currently) unable to replicate with shotclock is the deep hardware/software integration that is possible with some scales. Maybe future me will venture into this space one day, but for now the goal is to keep it simple.

## Build it yourself

First off, get this sucker onto your computer, once your there open the folder and install the dependencies

```bash
pnpm i
# or for npm
npm i
```

Once you have done that, spin up the dev server

```bash
pnpm dev
# or for npm
npm run dev
```

Have fun!
